# Nema14-dual-drive-geared-extruder
A Nema 14 dual drive geared extruder made from scratch. The prject was made with SolidWoks 2010 
(any posterior version of SolidWorks will open the files). The SolidWors2010 folder contains all the parts required,
as weel as the assembly file Gear 15x69.SLDASM. 1x69 stands for the gears' teeth number used in the project.  

The project was used to extrude a 1.75 mm ABS filament heated to 220C through a 0,4 mm nozzle. A Feed Rate of 9 mm/s
was possible without slipping or motor stall. ths means that flow rate obtained was 25 mm3/s, enough to print at 
speeds of 200 mm/s.
